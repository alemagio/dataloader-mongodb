# Carretto

`Carretto` is a set of utilities to improve and simplify the usage of [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).

## Introduction

`Carretto` has the concept of `key` which is an object having the following shape:

```ts
{
  query: unknown
  projection: Record<string, 1>
  skip?: number
  limit?: number
}
```

Fields of the `key`:

- `query`: represents the way to obtain the resource, which means, for database the actual query, for a REST API the url of the resource ecc.
- `projection`: the fields you are interested in the resource.
- `skip`: the number of elements you want to skip.
- `limit`: the maximum amount of elements you want to get.

### Query

`Carretto` assumes every key having the same `query` field will point to the same resource.

Multiple calls to resources identified with keys having the same `query` field will result in a single call.

### Projection

When trying to access resources identified with keys having the same `query` field, the resulted projection will be a merge of the projections of the single keys.

For an example of this behavior see [mongodb](./packages/mongodb/README.md).

### Skip and Limit

`skip` and `limit` are optional since if the are populated `carretto` will assume the result is a list of elements, instead, if these fields are not populated, the result will be considered a single object.

When multiple resources identified by keys having the same `query` have different `skip` and `limit` the calls will result in a single call having:

- `skip` the minimum of the `skip` fields of the single keys
- `limit` the maximum of the `limit` fields of the single keys

**Note**

TODO: this behavior is not ideal and in the following versions will be more customizable.
